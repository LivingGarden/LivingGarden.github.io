Despite the risks associated with volcanic events, many people live near active volcanoes. This presents a problem for disaster management agencies who struggle to mitigate the risks volcanoes pose to local populations. In order to plan for the eventuality of a volcanic event some basic information is essential; where are the buildings, roads and other critical infrastructure in proximity to the hazard.

##Why Data is Important
Data about nearby communities helps develop a general idea about the risk a volcano poses and can assist in the formulation of a hazard mitigation/responce plan. Having such a plan ready before a disaster occurs is beneficial for emergency response activities during all stages of the response.

For an effective response to any disaster it is crucial to know how many people may be affected in a particular area. When current population estimates are not available, the number of buildings can be used to estimate the population at risk from a particular volcanic hazard. This is critical to know before the onset of a disaster because these types of estimates are often used as inputs to many emergency planning decisions in proportioning budgets or prepositioning aid supplies for instance.

Basic infrastructure data is also critical in identifying specifically what is at risk. For several years USAID has worked with the USGS and local scientific agencies to develop and implement sophisticated software used in modelling volcano related hazards. Programs like [LaharZ](http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr98638 "USGS Publication") can model inundation zones of the mud and ash slurry (called Lahars) that flow from a volcano but this information is only valuable when disaster managers know what is at risk within these zones.

Accurate information about the transportation network and nearby communities are also helpful in planning evacuations and other activities that involve boots on the ground. 

##The Missing Piece 
Despite the multiple use cases for infrastructure data in emergency management when a disaster is imminent or has occurre, disaster management agencies called to respond they often find that the data available to them is outdated, inaccessible or non-existent.

The image below depicts a map used by the Indonesian National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB) during a training exercise. The map highlights the town of Kabanjahe in its inset which depict lonely intersecting roads. This image belies the fact that Kabanjahe is a vibrant town filled with buildings, markets, schools and people; a fact that is obvious in the satellite imagery underneath. In fact, Kabanjahe is the seat of local government and the trade center of Karo Regency!

Anybody with a computer and access to navigation apps can easily see that more spatial data about our world exists now than at any time in the past. Unfortunately this wealth of information is not spread evenly in all places on the globe an in many less developed regions where commercial data providers have less incentive to travel data is still hard to find or non-existant. 

##New Opportunities In Participitory Data Creation
[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/540924177#map=15/3.0991/98.4919 "Web map created with OSM data and focused on Kabanjahe")(OSM) has changed the dynamic of who can take an active role in deciding what should be on maps and in our global commons. In doing so it has provided a platform for creating data that has humanitarian value and making it available to for use by all actors involved in humanitarian response. 

There are plenty of resources available online where you can read more about [what OSM is](http://derickrethans.nl/what-is-openstreetmap.html "Blog post by Derick Rethans"), [why it is important to humanitarian response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2kvyhM6U38#t=203), and [how to contribute](http://mapgive.state.gov/ "The Department of State MapGive Project") so we dont go deep into it here but in a broad sense it is a shared repository of spatial data which is open and free for anybody to contribute to and make use of. OSM has garnered significant interest and investment from humanitarian agencies such as the Department of State/HIU, International Red Cross, USAID, the World Bank, etc who see the potential for this platform to fill needs for various data that have humanitarian consequence.   

The most famous use case for OSM being used for a humanitarian purpose is still the volunteer effort to built a map of Port-Au-Price after the onset of the Earthquake that devastated the city in 2010.

As you can see in the video above the earthquakes devastation focused global attention on the situation and turned out a massive effort from volunteers who produced the best set of spatial data for the city to have ever existed in one place. The value of this data is evidenced by its wide use by international responce organizations. 

Since 2010 OSM efforts like this have become common and various humanitarian organizations have been actively promoting and participating in them. A few recent examples: 

* Department of State's Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) collaborated with the International Red Cross (IFRC) and Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) to perform [damage assessments](http://bit.ly/1wMBS37) in Tacloban after cyclone Yolanda (Haiyan).

* HIU and IFRC also collaborated to map communities in west africa affected by the [Ebola outbreak](http://bit.ly/ZeRWj2). 
Previous mapping parties have looked very different depending on what is being mapped and the level of local knowledge needed. Sometimes they require extensive training support or some level of local knowledge while sometimes basic knowledge about how to navigate a web browser is sufficient for participants to contribute to the map. In this case, infrastructure around volcanoes is generally easy enough to trace from satellite imagery that there is little technical skill needed for interested volunteers to participate.

These efforts have very often been associated with the kind of early onset disasters that generate media attention and drive volunteers to participate. While these efforts have generated a lot of good and useful data there is still a long way to go and many areas around active volcanoes are still not very well represented.

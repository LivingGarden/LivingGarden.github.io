Whether drawn by their furtile volcanic soils, cultural attachments, or natural beauty; communities around the world live near volcanoes.

This presents a problem for disaster management agencies who stuggle to mitigate the risks volcanoes pose to local populations. In order to plan for the eventuality of a volcanic eruption some basic information is essential; where are the buildings, roads and other infrastructure in relation to the hazard. 

Data about the built environment helps transition a general idea about the danger a volcano poses to specific characterizations of the risks involved and a better context for formulating response plans. When available this kind of data is useful in many different ways and at different stages of emergency management.

When updated population estimates are not available the number of buildings can be used to estimate the number of people at risk from a particular volcanic hazard, something that is very useful to know before the onset of a disaster. At risk population estimates are often used as inputs to many emergency planning decisions; for instance in proportioning budgets or prepositioning aid supplies.

Basic infrastructure data is also in highlighting specifically what is at risk. For years USAID has worked with USGS and local scientific agencies to develop and implement sophisticated software used in modelling volcano related hazards. Programs like LaharZ can model inundation zones of the mud and ash slurry (called Lahars) that flow down a volcano but this information only becomes really valuable when disaster managers know what is at risk within these zones.

Accurate information about the road network and communities around volcanoes are also used in planning evacuations and other activities that involve boots on the ground. 

Despite the multiple use cases for infrastructure data in emergency management when a disaster is imminent or an eruption has occured and management agencies are called to respond they often find that the data available to them is outdated, innaxessable or non-existant.

The image below depicts a map used by the Indonesian National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB) during a training exercise. The map highlights the town of Kabanjahe in its inset which depict lonely intersecting roads. This image belies what satelite imagery reveals; that Kabanjahe is a vibrant town filled with buildings, markets, schools and people. In fact, Kabanjahe is the seat of local government and the trade centre of Karo Regency but because the only data available was the road data that is what was used. 

A quick look at google maps and it is quickly appearant that more spatial data about the world we live in exists than at any time in the past and in truth many basic types of features like roads are very well covered in the developed world. This is not the case in many less developed or rural areas where commertial data providers have less insentive to travel. 

[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/540924177#map=15/3.0991/98.4919) has changed this dynamic in that it opens opportunity to develop this kind of data collaboratively. 

##OpenStreetMap

There are plenty of resources available online like LINK and LINK where you can read more about OpenStreetMap(OSM), how it started and how to contribute so we dont go deep into it here but in a broad sense it is a shared repository of spatial data which is open and free for anybody to contribute to and make use of. OSM has garnered significant interest and investment from humanitarian agencies such as the Department of State/HIU, International Red Cross, USAID, the World Bank, etc who see the potential for this platform to fill needs for various data that have humanitarian consequence.   

The most famous use case for OSM being used for a humanitarian purpose is still the volunteer effort to built a map of Port-Au-Price after the onset of the Earthquake that devastated the city in 2010.

As you can see in the video above the earthquakes devastation focused global attention on the situation and turned out a massive effort from volunteers who produced the best set of spatial data for the city to have ever existed in one place. The value of this data is evidenced by its wide use by international responce organizations. 

Since 2010 OSM efforts like this have become common and various humanitarian organizations have been actively promoting and participating in them. A few recent examples: 

* Department of State's Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) collaborated with the International Red Cross (IFRC) and Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) to perform [damage assessments](http://bit.ly/1wMBS37) in Tacloban after cyclone Yolanda (Haiyan).

* HIU and IFRC also collaborated to map communities in west africa affected by the [Ebola outbreak](http://bit.ly/ZeRWj2). 
Previous mapping parties have looked very different depending on what is being mapped and the level of local knowledge needed. Sometimes they require extensive training support or some level of local knowledge while sometimes basic knowledge about how to navigate a web browser is sufficient for participants to contribute to the map. In this case, infrastructure around volcanoes is generally easy enough to trace from satellite imagery that there is little technical skill needed for interested volunteers to participate.

These efforts have very often been associated with the kind of early onset disasters that generate media attention and drive volunteers to participate. While these efforts have generated a lot of good and useful data there is still a long way to go and many areas around active volcanoes are still not very well represented.

To assist USGS's Volcano Disaster Assistance Program, USAID/OFDA's Indonesian programs, and the broader humanitarian community's capacity to plan and respond to eruptions at the target volcanoes, a data creation event centered around the OpenStreetMap platform may be an optimal way to both create data and engage the local Indonesian community. This event would promote the creation of data on the location and distribution of buildings, roads and agricultural fields. Volunteers would either map a 50 km radius around the volcano or major adjacent cities.

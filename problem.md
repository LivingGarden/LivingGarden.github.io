Whether drawn by their furtile volcanic soils, cultural attachments, or natural beauty; communities around the world live near volcanoes.

This presents a problem for disaster management agencies who stuggle to mitigate the risks volcanoes pose to local populations. In order to plan for the eventuality of a volcanic eruption some basic information is essential; where are the buildings, roads and other infrastructure in relation to the hazard. 


Data about the built environment helps transition a general idea about the danger a volcano poses to specific characterizations of the risks involved and a better context for formulating response plans. When available this kind of data is useful in many different ways and at different stages of emergency management.

When updated population estimates are not available the number of buildings can be used to estimate the number of people at risk from a particular volcanic hazard, something that is very useful to know before the onset of a disaster. At risk population estimates are often used as inputs to many emergency planning decisions; for instance in proportioning budgets or prepositioning aid supplies.

Another pre disaster use case for basic infrastructure data is in highlighting specifically what is at risk. For years USAID has worked with USGS and local scientific agencies to develop and implement sophisticated software used for modelling some of the hazards related to active Volcanoes. These sofware have be












###Decision Making

Many national governments, IGOs, and NGOs, including USAID/OFDA partners, use OpenStreetMap data for planning. This evacuation planning map and subsequent image highlights the scarcity of quality information about many at-risk areas.

##Solution

To assist USGS's Volcano Disaster Assistance Program, USAID/OFDA's Indonesian programs, and the broader humanitarian community's capacity to plan and respond to eruptions at the target volcanoes, a data creation event centered around the OpenStreetMap platform may be an optimal way to both create data and engage the local Indonesian community. This event would promote the creation of data on the location and distribution of buildings, roads and agricultural fields. Volunteers would either map a 50 km radius around the volcano or major adjacent cities.

###OpenStreetMap

Using OpenStreetMap to organize areas to map has been made easier through the use of the OSM Tasking Manager. An example of which can be seen for Kelud [HERE](http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/425).

###What is Volunteer Data Creation?

Volunteer data creation refers to activities that encourage a group of volunteers to create and edit spatial information using a variety of sources (such as satellite imagery) in a database that is freely open and available to the humanitarian community. Often these activities are organized around specific events called mapping parties in which participants meet to edit the map together.

As previously mentioned, activities are typically organized around editing data into OpenStreetMap. OSM is preferable to alternative map platforms because all the data created is freely available to all users. For this reason, OSM has garnered significant interest and investment from humanitarian agencies such as the Department of State/HIU, USAID/Geocenter, International Red Cross, as well as USAID/OFDA. For example, OFDA recently provided funding for an update to the OpenStreetMap tasking server which was build to aid in the coordination of volunteer mapping events.

Other recent examples include:

* Department of State's Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) collaborated with the International Red Cross (IFRC) and Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) to perform [damage assessments](http://bit.ly/1wMBS37) in Tacloban after cyclone Yolanda (Haiyan).

* HIU and IFRC also collaborated to map communities in west africa affected by the [Ebola outbreak](http://bit.ly/ZeRWj2). 
Previous mapping parties have looked very different depending on what is being mapped and the level of local knowledge needed. Sometimes they require extensive training support or some level of local knowledge while sometimes basic knowledge about how to navigate a web browser is sufficient for participants to contribute to the map. In this case, infrastructure around volcanoes is generally easy enough to trace from satellite imagery that there is little technical skill needed for interested volunteers to participate.

Beyond the collection of of useful data, volunteer mapping also serves as a productive outreach vehicle. These activities convene interest around the subject and give interested parties an avenue to participate in international humanitarianism productively.

Open data initiatives and volunteer communities are helping to fix these information gaps around the world. OpenStreetMap, often referred to as the Wikipedia of maps, is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. The images below highlight infrastructure added to OpenStreetMap (OSM) in central Jakarta.

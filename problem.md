Whether drawn by their furtile volcanic soils, cultural attachments, or sheer beauty; communities around the world live near volcanoes and with the constant threat of their eruption. In order to mitigate the risk posed to local communities disaster management agencies some basic data is essential. Where are buildings, roads and other basic infrastruction in relation to the volcano?  This kind of basic data is essential to knowing what specifically is in danger and working with this kind of data can help responce agencies formulate strategies to deal with the risks associated with living with volcanoes. 






###Decision Making

Many national governments, IGOs, and NGOs, including USAID/OFDA partners, use OpenStreetMap data for planning. This evacuation planning map and subsequent image highlights the scarcity of quality information about many at-risk areas.

##Solution

To assist USGS's Volcano Disaster Assistance Program, USAID/OFDA's Indonesian programs, and the broader humanitarian community's capacity to plan and respond to eruptions at the target volcanoes, a data creation event centered around the OpenStreetMap platform may be an optimal way to both create data and engage the local Indonesian community. This event would promote the creation of data on the location and distribution of buildings, roads and agricultural fields. Volunteers would either map a 50 km radius around the volcano or major adjacent cities.

###OpenStreetMap

Using OpenStreetMap to organize areas to map has been made easier through the use of the OSM Tasking Manager. An example of which can be seen for Kelud [HERE](http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/425).

###What is Volunteer Data Creation?

Volunteer data creation refers to activities that encourage a group of volunteers to create and edit spatial information using a variety of sources (such as satellite imagery) in a database that is freely open and available to the humanitarian community. Often these activities are organized around specific events called mapping parties in which participants meet to edit the map together.

As previously mentioned, activities are typically organized around editing data into OpenStreetMap. OSM is preferable to alternative map platforms because all the data created is freely available to all users. For this reason, OSM has garnered significant interest and investment from humanitarian agencies such as the Department of State/HIU, USAID/Geocenter, International Red Cross, as well as USAID/OFDA. For example, OFDA recently provided funding for an update to the OpenStreetMap tasking server which was build to aid in the coordination of volunteer mapping events.

Other recent examples include:

* Department of State's Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) collaborated with the International Red Cross (IFRC) and Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) to perform [damage assessments](http://bit.ly/1wMBS37) in Tacloban after cyclone Yolanda (Haiyan).

* HIU and IFRC also collaborated to map communities in west africa affected by the [Ebola outbreak](http://bit.ly/ZeRWj2). 
Previous mapping parties have looked very different depending on what is being mapped and the level of local knowledge needed. Sometimes they require extensive training support or some level of local knowledge while sometimes basic knowledge about how to navigate a web browser is sufficient for participants to contribute to the map. In this case, infrastructure around volcanoes is generally easy enough to trace from satellite imagery that there is little technical skill needed for interested volunteers to participate.

Beyond the collection of of useful data, volunteer mapping also serves as a productive outreach vehicle. These activities convene interest around the subject and give interested parties an avenue to participate in international humanitarianism productively.

Open data initiatives and volunteer communities are helping to fix these information gaps around the world. OpenStreetMap, often referred to as the Wikipedia of maps, is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. The images below highlight infrastructure added to OpenStreetMap (OSM) in central Jakarta.

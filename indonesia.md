For background on open data and the OpenStreetMap platform, see the [PROBLEM](http://wuhland.github.io/opendata/) section.

The first planned mapping project will be conducted in Indonesia. The focus of the mapping event will be exclusively on volcanic regions of the country. Volcanoes were chosen because they present a clear future hazard to surrounding cities. More than 75% of Indonesians live within 100 km of the country's approx. 127 active volcanoes, the highest number in the world. 

Proximity to volcanoes coupled with Indonesia's sizable population density (237 million), makes any volcanic eruption has the potential for widespread damage. Between 1980 and 2008, approximately 300,000 Indonesians have been affected at a cost of $160 million USD.

##PLAN OF ACTION

The severe lack of available data around Volcanoes in Indonesia was highlighted by OFDAâ€™s Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) as a particular challenge to its ability to model the risks posed by volcanic hazards in these areas. VDAP is interested in creating data for these vulnerable areas and working with their counterparts in Indonesia to use these data to improve hazard assessments. They have highlighted 10 priority volcanoes.

The long-term plan is to map all populated areas within a 50km radius of each of the volcanoes.

##DATA BENEFITS

OpenStreetMap data is freely available for anyone to download and use in a variety of software. The data produced from this mapping party will be used in several applications. This data can be used in hazard risk models, to inform development decisions or for a variety of other purposes.

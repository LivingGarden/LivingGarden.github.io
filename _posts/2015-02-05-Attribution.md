##Tagging Features

###Tagging
It is important that features are tagged appropriately and consistently. 

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>Initial Tag</th>
      <th>General Tag</th>
      <th>Specific Tag</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>All Buildings</td>
      <td>Building</td>
      <td>Building</td>
      <td>House</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Water Features</td>
      <td>Water</td>
      <td>River/Lake</td>
      <td>Ditch/Stream</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>All Roads and Highways</td>
      <td>Road</td>
      <td>Road</td>
      <td>Primary/Residential</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Only use the specific tags when applicable. For all other features, please use general tags such as "building", "road", etc.

###Attributes
Similar to tagging, more in-depth information about a feature in the OpenStreetMap database should be added when applicable. Only add attribute information if you have the accurate infromation regarding the features.

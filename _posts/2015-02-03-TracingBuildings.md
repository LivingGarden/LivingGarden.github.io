##Buildings

Common building types in this region include, but are not limited to: homes, health clinics, schools, religious structures, shops, and agriculture.

How to Trace Buildings
To trace buildings, place a node around every corner. Some buildings will be harder to discern than others--in these cases, trace the buildings as best as possible. When tracing is complete, remember to tag the newly added feature. See the images below for a step-by-step explaination on how to trace a building.

###Roads

Editing Road Features:
Similar to the river features, not all road data is properly traced in OSM and can be edited. Roads may also not be completely, in which case a user can finish tracing the length of the road.

Creating Road Features:
There are plenty of roads that have not been traced into OpenStreetMap yet. If it is unclear what type of road it is, use the general "road" tag.

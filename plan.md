#INDONESIAN VOLCANOES

##SUMMARY

To assist USGS's Volcano Disaster Assistance Program, USAID/OFDA's Indonesian programs, and the broader humanitarian community's capacity to plan and respond to eruptions at the target volcanoes, a data creation event centered around the OpenStreetMap platform may be an optimal way to both create data and engage the local Indonesian community. This event would promote the creation of data on the location and distribution of buildings, roads and agricultural fields. Volunteers would either map a 50 km radius around the volcano or major adjacent cities.

For background on open data and the OpenStreetMap platform, see the [PROBLEM](http://wuhland.github.io/opendata/) section.

The first planned mapping project will be conducted in Indonesia. The focus of the mapping event will be exclusively on volcanic regions of the country. Volcanoes were chosen because they present a clear future hazard to surrounding cities. More than 75% of Indonesians live within 100 km of the country's approx. 127 active volcanoes, the highest number in the world. 

Proximity to volcanoes coupled with Indonesia's sizable population density (237 million), makes any volcanic eruption has the potential for widespread damage. Between 1980 and 2008, approximately 300,000 Indonesians have been affected at a cost of $160 million USD.

##PLAN OF ACTION

The severe lack of available data around Volcanoes in Indonesia was highlighted by OFDAâ€™s Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) as a particular challenge to its ability to model the risks posed by volcanic hazards in these areas. VDAP is interested in creating data for these vulnerable areas and working with their counterparts in Indonesia to use these data to improve hazard assessments. They have highlighted 10 priority volcanoes.

The long-term plan is to map all populated areas within a 50km radius of each of the volcanoes. This will be a big task, as some volcanoes have several urban clusters within the target area. To determine how much effort will be needed to map all 10 volcanoes, the event's focus will be on mapping Kelud and *Volcano*. 

Exactly how much work will be needed to complete the volcanoes will depend heavily on the surrounding area. Kelud, for example, has a number of large urban clusters within a 50km radius. Because of this, some effort has been done by NGOs to map Kelud. The American Red Cross and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team have begun the process of mapping the volcano, though a majority remains un-mapped. The ongoing OpenStreetMap task can be found [HERE](http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/425). *The second volcano short background...*

To map Kelud and *other volcano*, we will be working with USAID Global Development Lab's Geocenter--sepecifically their Mapping for Resilience program. The Geocenter teams up with the George Washington University to map areas of interest.

##DATA USE

OpenStreetMap data is freely available for anyone to download and use in a variety of software. The data produced from this mapping party will be used in several applications. Mostly, for the purposes of USAID and NGOs, the data will be used in hazard risk models and to supplement development programs. For more information on how OpenStreetMap data is used, see the [PROBLEM](http://wuhland.github.io/opendata/) section.

More than 75% of Indonesians live within 100 km of the country's approx. 127 active volcanoes, the highest number in the world. Between 1980 and 2008, approximately 300,000 Indonesians have been affected by volcanic hazards at a cost of $160 million USD. To assist the humanitarian responce community's capacity to plan and respond to volcano hazards in Indonesia we are promoting  participatory mapping of critical infrastructure using OpenStreetMap.

##PLAN OF ACTION

The severe lack of available data around Volcanoes in Indonesia was highlighted by OFDAâ€™s Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) as a particular challenge to its ability to model the risks posed by volcanic hazards in these areas. VDAP is interested in creating data for these vulnerable areas and working with their counterparts in Indonesia to use these data to improve hazard assessments. They have highlighted 10 priority volcanoes.

The long-term plan is to map all populated areas within a 50km radius of each of the volcanoes. This will be a big task, as some volcanoes have several towns within the area of interest. To determine how much effort will be needed to map all 10 volcanoes, the event's focus will be on mapping Kelud and *Volcano*. 

Exactly how much work will be needed to complete the volcanoes will depend heavily on the surrounding area. Kelud, for example, has a number of large urban clusters within a 50km radius and will take some time to complete. Luckily, part of the job has already been completed as the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team have already started coordinating volunteers in mapping the area and have promoted it in coordination with the Missing Maps project begun mapping the volcano. The ongoing OpenStreetMap task can be found [HERE](http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/425). *The second volcano short background...*

To map Kelud and *other volcano*, we will be working with USAID Global Development Lab's Geocenter--sepecifically their Mapping for Resilience program. The Geocenter teams up with the George Washington University to map areas of interest.

##DATA USE

OpenStreetMap data is freely available for anyone to download and use in a variety of software. The data produced from this mapping party will be used in several applications. Mostly, for the purposes of USAID and NGOs, the data will be used in hazard risk models and to supplement development programs. For more information on how OpenStreetMap data is used, see the [PROBLEM](http://wuhland.github.io/opendata/) section.
